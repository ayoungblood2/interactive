        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">ultra-sound</span>
          is a deeply introspective
          and semi-autobiographical project
          that delves into the intricate fabric of
          the Black family unit, adolescence,
          technology, and growth. Rooted in
          personal experiences and
          memories, this creation takes an
          innovative approach to storytelling,
          defying linear time and embracing
          the complexities of memory and
          identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The title <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">ultra-sound</span>
          embodies the
          enveloping sensation of life within
          the mother's womb. It’s the essence
          of that abstract warmth, the
          sanctuary of safety, and the yearning
          to both embrace the external world
          and yet remain cocooned in security
          within a familiar familial embrace.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">ultra-sound</span>
          offers a
          poignant reflection on the essence of
          the Black family within the context of
          white suburbia. This exploration
          extends to themes of childhood,
          love, dreams, resilience, and growth.
          Through the lens of video-making
          and familial connections, ultra-sound
          becomes a creation of voyeuristic
          self-discovery through a loop of past
          reflections weaved into a
          mesmerizing tapestry of emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, the video's MFA thesis exhibition installation
          juxtaposes
          the past and present,
          realized through archival super-8
          footage meticulously collected over
          time. This visual narrative is brought
          to life within a moving image
          installation of super-8 editors,
          connecting generations and bridging
          the gap between memories and the
          contemporary world. Accompanying
          this installation is a CRT TV monitor,
          powered by a raspberry pi 4, which
          showcases my thesis video. This
          synthesis of technology and
          personal history serves to
          accentuate the project's themes and
          emotions.
        </p>
        <p><span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">ultra-sound</span>
          reaches its zenith as an
          experimental documentary that
          intertwines the tender cadence of a
          mother's voice messages with the
          candid lens of a father's camcorder
          recordings. The outcome is an
          audio-visual symphony that artfully
          captures the essence of familial
          bonds, growth, and shared history.
          By intertwining these two distinct
          media sources, along with various
          others, the project crafts a
          multidimensional portrayal of family
          dynamics, emphasizing the intricate
          ways in which relationships are
          nurtured and communication
          unfolds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The film weaves an
          audiovisual experience that parallels
          the intricate relationship between
          technology and humanity. This
          exploration provokes how our
          connection with technology mirrors
          the intimate bond of a child with its
          family. Just as the child senses the
          world through the mother's womb,
          technology becomes the conduit
          through which we experience and
          interact with our evolving reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within this artistic exploration, the
          project delves deep into the realms
          of memory and identity, offering
          viewers a compelling journey
          through the tapestry of personal
          history. By spotlighting the nuanced
          and multifaceted nature of human
          connections, ultra-sound sheds light
          on the profound complexity that
          underlies our most cherished
          relationships. Through its thought-provoking
          narrative and innovative
          presentation, the project ultimately
          invites audiences to consider their
          own familial narratives and the
          profound impact of technology on
          the shaping of memories and
          identities.

          i grew up in a family of 8. mom, dad,
          5 girls, 1 boy. 3 dogs. texas. <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">the

          laying on the couch passively
          observing your older sibling play
          video games. sitting at the kitchen
          counter watching tv. there’s a lot of
          idle time, observing, contemplating
          nothing or daydreaming about what
          else is out there. dreaming the
          undreamed. the undreamed

          given the context —
          a celebration of life as a reflection of
          the past, of memories. nostalgic
          summers in the suburbs, ice cream
          dripping down a child's hand in the
          middle of a heatwave.

        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">portrait at work</span> reinterprets a collection of 1960s archival footage into a short film. the footage is of a
          middle-class italian immigrant family shoveling snow from their suburban neighborhood in Ohio. this footage is a select part of the same super-8 film collection assembled in my <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">ultra-sound</span> super-8 editors moving image installation for the MFA thesis exhibition.
        </p>
        <p>
          the original footage is shot on super-8 film, then viewed frame-by-frame, as I manually roll through the film on a
          super-8 editor viewer. a literal translation of the moving image is dissected and remixed within the medium of
          the film reel. the beauty of movement cut and captured by each frame, each image, slowed down and appreciated
          as an impression upon a memory of the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          at its core, this short of a <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">portrait at work</span> is an
          ode to the blinking eye, and the mechanisms mankind built in its like. the shutter that captures and
          recaptures a memory. it's a simple take on the moving image, paired with mica levi's <span
            style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Vanity</span>, mimicking the impression of a trapped butterfly
          dancing against a window, beautiful yet mournful. so to is that nostalgia of the captured image, an imprisoned
          memory within a film strip, beating against the light of the projector, its only form of release.

          fiction short story, <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">ENTER/RETURN
            ultra-sound</span>. I
          crafted this
          speculative fiction about the cul-desacs
          of "ultra-sound," a unique
          suburb where two distinct "Qults"
          coexist within the fabric of the New
          World Web (NWW or The Web).
        </p>
        <p>
          The main narrative is an intricate
          interplay between the virtual and the
          tangible, where the once-separate
          realms of the internet and physical
          reality have converged. The focus of
          the narrative revolves around two
          distinct "Qults": "The Black Kids of
          Suburbia," led by the enigmatic
          Black Orion Aeon (BOA), and the
          "Cul-de-sac Girls," under the
          leadership of the charismatic
          Ariadne the Driver (Ari). Both cults
          inhabit “ultra-sound," positioned at
          the nexus between the austral and
          boreal hypersphere, a looping
          construct intricately connected by
          cul-de-sacs at either end.

            test to

            name.</span> explores the intricate
          relationships between technology,
          society, and personal identity. The
          narrative questions the nature of
          reality in a world where the digital
          and physical coexist in an
          inseparable dance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phrase "<span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">this is a
            test to
            see if i can say my
            name.</span>" is a continual
          testing of my own identity and ability
          to articulate it in my practice. This
          phrase becomes a touchstone for
          my exploration of language, and the
          ways in which it both shapes and
          reflects our understanding of
          humanity. My practice, my work, is a
          continual test to see if I can say my
          name, “my name is Avery.” It is

          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">more real
            than
            myself</span> is a semi-autobiographical
          extended reality
          experience that is a virtual video
          installation and performance that
          conceptually questions what we
          perceive to be the reality of our
          "individuality" or what makes
          "us"..."us."
        </p>
        <p>
          In this piece, I question the
          existence of originality, reality vs.
          fiction, memory, uprooted identity,
          and individuality. When our world –
          what we see and make – is one
          huge spiral, a feedback loop of
          entangled past, present, and future.
          When everything is referential or
          rooted in the past that informs the
          present, which directs our future, I
          wonder where the individual lies
          within this?
        </p>
        <p>
          When realized, this video installation
          performance is a virtual 3D model of
          myself made through Unreal Engine
          and Blender, interacting with my
          physical self in real-time. I am
          having a two-way dialogue that is
          partly based in personal narrative
          and partly based on Samuel
          Delany’s science fiction novel,
          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Dhalgren</span>,
          that is using an AI trained
          voice as my own voice in the live
          performance and video.
        </p>
        <p>
          It appears as if both the virtual and
          physical self are learning from each
          other’s narrative in the process of
          exchange, unable to tell who's story
          belongs to who…maybe there's no
          difference between the two.

          Through a meticulously crafted
          assortment of flyers, a captivating
          publication, and an innovative
          website (<span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">bathhouse.online</span>),
          this
          project embodies the ethos of
          sculptor Amina Ross and their eight
          thought exercises:
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">
            The bathhouse is safe.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is not secure.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is a space to be seen.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is not a place to be
            watched.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is sensual.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is not unspiritual.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is a space for
            meaningful work.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is not a workplace.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is a technology.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is not a machine.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is immersive.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is not without a body.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is sweating.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is not drained.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is gone.
            <br>
            The bathhouse is not over.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The collection of flyers with custom
          hand lettering, harkens back to the
          era of queer rave flyers from the
          90s, beckoning to underground
          spaces that have historically
          provided solace for marginalized
          communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          These flyers aren't merely static
          images; they bear the weight of
          human touch. Each one, Riso
          printed and then subjected to
          intentional destruction by hand,
          serves as a testimony to the
          ephemeral nature of community,
          much like flyers left to the elements.
          Beginning with pristine flyers, it
          gradually immerses the reader into
          the narrative of degradation, where
          successive flyers bear the marks of
          deterioration. This tangible textural
          experience leafing through the
          publication mirrors the passage of
          time and the evolving state of
          weathered outdoor flyers. The static
          archive becomes an engaging
          material and sensorial experience.

          Arrange yourself, then arrange the other, then let the other arrange you, then let the system arrange itself

          Are we truly at the center of our own story? Am I in control of my own language and legibility or is the

        </p>
        <p>
          The self versus the other versus the environment. We are never at the center, but neither is anything else.
          All connected at the periphery of an-other’s positionality and perspective, there is no sole origin, only
          origin and end-origin – one-and-the-same. I am, as you are, as we are, in constant juxtaposition to the
          center, to ourselves. The positive feedback loop of a spiral that surrounds us and makes us who we are that
          rhizomatically stems outward and inward, a reflection of ourselves that is ultimately a mirror of the other,
          at once suspended in unfixed metalogic.

          In an exploration of body, space, and time, <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">oscillations,
            colored.</span> was a performance based on the 1956 Montgomery bus boycott.
          The participant at the front of the seating arrangement would place everyone in the seating arrangement across
          from them, and then the passengers would all turn around and the passenger at the very back would then become
          the front conductor in charge of arranging the others, again. Only those participating were aware of the rules
          of arrangement, onlookers unaware of the inner systemic hierarchy at play between the conductor and the
          passengers at the conductor's will.

          Is it the path things take that lead us
          to the right path? What is the right
          path? Do you twist and turn to get
          there, submerged in dirt you find
          yourself, is that me?
          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Twist, the
            path
            things take</span>, employs
          the canvas of nature to probe the
          intricate question of Blackness—an
          identity shaped by a non-origin, a
          name and roots forcibly stripped
          away. This powerful metaphor likens
          the experience to the uprooting of a
          tree, seeking solid ground, seeking
          foundation, seeking origin. We're
          forcibly introduced into a society and
          culture, untethered from our roots,
          our past. This profound rebirth,
          layered with societal rejection and
          an absence of ancestral knowledge,
          breeds a process of adaptation and
          survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          This metamorphosis—born from the
          crucible of destruction—begets a
          new realm of language and
          relationships. Just as the earthworm
          burrows, regenerates, and thrives,
          so do we. We become the
          embodiment of resilience, navigating
          the environment we inhabit. And as
          the earthworm tills the soil and
          fosters new growth, we too foster
          new forms of connection and
          emergence from the ruins of our
          past histories.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrative of <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Twist</span>
          transcends
          linear storytelling, delving into the
          depths of identity, adaptation, and
          survival. By harnessing the
          symbolism of nature, the video
          encapsulates the intertwined
          essence of struggle and triumph,
          decay and renewal.

          unveils itself as
          a prelude, setting the stage for a
          thought-provoking exploration of
          interconnectedness and the ever-circling
          nature of origins. This web
          design lays the foundation for the
          subsequent narrative, Twist or Twist,
          the path things take, inviting viewers
          into a realm where the beginning
          and end are intertwined in an eternal
          loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The video-walkthrough of the
          website begins with a clip from the
          TV mini-series <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Station
            Eleven</span>, a
          snippet that contemplates the
          enigmatic relationship between
          origins and their final destinations,
          suggesting an infinite cyclical
          pattern, the seamless continuity that
          underpins existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website harnesses Wikipedia’s
          API to pull the first eight links from
          the wiki page searched by the user
          on the site.The links form the lines of
          the asterisk in Black space, and
          when a user clicks on one of these
          asterisk link lines, a new dimension
          unfurls—the viewer is ushered to the
          next link in a cascading progression.
          This dynamic structure eloquently
          mirrors the very essence of
          knowledge, each click propelling the
          viewer into an ever-expanding realm
          of information.
        </p>
        <p>
          E.g., user searches “life,” API pulls
          links from "life" wiki page, user clicks
          on a link from this page, e.g. the
          "physical entities" link, next set of
          links from the "physical entities" wiki
          page load, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website's functionality along
          with the asterisk's visual symbol
          becomes a testament to the intrinsic
          interdependence of our collective
          knowledge and language. No
          knowledge exists in isolation but
          rather as a tapestry woven from the
          threads of countless interlocking
          thoughts and philosophies.

          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Khalik Allah</span> is an American filmmaker and
          photographer. I was commissioned by the yale school of art to design a poster announcement for allah's artist talk, part of yale's photo lecture series.
        </p>
        <p>
          Allah's work has been described as "street opera" simultaneously visceral, hauntingly beautiful and
          penetrative. Exuding real and raw emotion through the spotlit facial expressions of the people he depicts in
          his photography, I decided to design a 3D character that physically/digitally embodied that raw emotion often
          depicted in the eyes of his human subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
          photographing ordinary people under the electric blue glow of bodega awnings in the Harlem night, i alluded to
          the glowing black skin that radiates in the night's neon lights by giving my female animation glittering skin
          that changes colors while walking beneath the strobing colors of passing lights.

          tin metal
        </p>
        <p>
          I melted and formed an alphabet out of tin metal and paired them with my own Black body. What does it mean for
          the Black body to be the metal? Are we the metal before the machine?
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been thinking about the phrases "Black hardware" and "the metal before the machine." The kind of hardware
          made out of metal, the kind of metal before the machine. Black metal. Hands, feet, arms, back, legs, black
          bodies, the kind that produces and reproduces. That kind of Black metal that bends over backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Black hardware” and “Black metal” connect with my physical presence and evolving identity, which feel out of
          place and marginalized in the suburbs. <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Black Melt</span>
          is “That kind of Black metal that bends over backwards” is the physical and emotional labor that Black bodies
          often have to perform in order to survive and thrive in a society that is not always welcoming or accepting of
          them, but reliant on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          also thinking of the juxtaposition of black bodies and the metal that makes machines, and how we were supposed
          to be the perfect cyborg or robot or zombie following every order, never sleeping, always laboring.

          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Malcolm Peacock</span> is a young, Black,
          multidisciplinary performance artist whose practice examines emotional and psychic spaces of Black subjects.
          Peacock is particularly interested in the intricacies of intimacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          i was commissioned by photographer davion alston to design <span
            style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Malcolm Peacock</span>'s visiting artist lecture announcement
          poster for the yale school of art photography lecture series.
        </p>
        <p>
          this poster design and installation was inspired from Peacock's use of synthetic braiding hair in a number of
          his artworks and performance pieces, including <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">For more
            than roses and notches in our belts</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">i had a
            long obituary</span>, where he lay in a makeshift bed of Kanekalon synthetic hair extensions, commonly used
          for hair braiding in the black community. using this same exact material, I knit a wearable garment out of
          Kanekalon braiding hair extensions. this garment was then used as the focal image in the poster design. For
          the poster design I photographed Davion Alston from behind, wearing my knitted hair garment creation with both
          hands wrapped around the garment, gently gripping its intricate texture in an intimate embrace.
        </p>
        <p>
          this same garment I re-use in my video, <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Twist</span>, as a
          braided garment from which worms emerge and submerge from, weaving in and out from its looped knots.
        </p>
        <p>
          in addition to the garment and poster, there is also a braided text installation that accompanies them on the
          wall space. I hand-pinned braids into the wall next to the poster design, announcing the information for the
          artist lecture. each letter is made from a culmination of individual braids &mdash; the artist name made from
          Twisted Kinky Hair Synthetic Crochet Braiding Hair Extensions and the above information made from individual
          crochet box braid pre-looped hair extensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          currently, i am designing a digital typeface based on this physically rendered, hand-lettered
          braiding-hair-text-installation, titled <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Twist</span>. in
          reference to my video piece of the same name, in which these braids reappear along with the knitted braiding
          hair garment.

        <p>
          Exploring themes of location,
          boundaries, projection, and freedom,
          I along with my collaborators —
          Gabriela Rassi, Sophie Kyle Collins,
          Yuseon Park — installed an edited and elongated looping version of Yuseon’s video
          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Magnetic
            Film</span>, on a <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">swing</span>
          and
          performed with this literal "moving
          image."
        </p>
        <p>
          The video <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Magnetic
            Film</span> is a series
          of physical signatures of cassette
          recordings, translated into visuals
          through coding glitches, pixel
          sorting, and data moshing. This
          visual transition was inspired from
          dragging an old movie file to a new
          desktop; the pixels of the movie
          screen were broken. So glitches,
          pixel sorting, and data moshing are
          the transitions between time and
          scale that evoke hierarchical or
          unequal relationships when
          experiencing "the old" in a new way.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">swing</span>
          responds to that feeling of the
          past being released and liberated
          from static memory. The release of
          the physical boundaries of a screen
          or projector or visual. The boundary
          of a free-flying <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">swing</span>,
          which is the
          radius of perceived space, is a kind
          of liberation from the physicality of
          the swingers. And the film itself is a
          liberation of pixels from the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, through this installation
          performance there are still realized
          physical limitations of "freedom,"
          both in relation to our bodies as the
          video could only fly off the walls and
          onto the floor within the limitations of
          the swing’s circular trajectory.

          a zine that dismantles
          misconceptions, shatters stigma,
          and redefines the discourse
          surrounding mental illness. Within
          these pages, I look at the history,
          societal perceptions, and personal
          experiences that converge to
          legitimize mental illness in public
          discourse.
        </p>
        <p>
          This zine serves to spotlight the
          intricate association between mental
          illness and its history of fetishization,
          gendered discrimination, and
          societal alienation. It’s an attempt to
          unveil the truth behind
          misunderstood diagnoses that have
          often been brushed aside as unreal
          or exaggerated by those who
          grapple with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The zine's pages are woven with the
          voices of four distinct narratives,
          each resonating in dialogue with the
          others. Through these carefully
          selected excerpts, insights emerge:
          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Illness as
            Metaphor</span> by Susan
          Sontag, <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Life
            with
            Lyme</span> by Meghan
          O’Rourke, Excerpts from <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">the Diary of
            Alice James</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">My Lobotomy:
            Howard
            Dully's Journey</span> from All Things
          Considered. The zine weaves these
          narratives in an act of reclamation,
          turning the spotlight onto the voices
          that have been marginalized for far

          What does it mean to start from
          Blackness? Starting from Blackness
          is to embark on a journey that defies
          conventional constraints. It's a
          paradoxical space where time both
          expands and collapses, leaving one
          exposed and vulnerable, yet
          intensely focused. Blackness serves
          as a lens that refracts truth,
          heightening perceptions and
          unveiling dimensions that are often
          felt but not seen. In this way,
          Blackness becomes a potent
          instrument of revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The endeavor to capture these
          intangible aspects of Blackness, is
          an effort to amplify awareness. By
          elevating the viewer's senses, we
          aim to reveal the myriad ways in
          which Blackness manifests. It's an
          unseen force that envelops and
          permeates, simultaneously invisible
          and omnipresent. This paradoxical
          nature adds to the boundless
          essence of Blackness, a concept
          that inherently defies confinement.

          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Zombie</span>
          is a
          short film, featuring my
          sister as the central protagonist.
          Drawing on the original Haitian
          concept of a zombie — an entity
          suspended between life and death
          with a soul caught in a state of limbo — the narrative draws
          parallels
          to the
          Black body's experience. The Black
          body navigates a space between
          worlds. It grapples with the tension
          of identity, the constant negotiation
          between belonging and exclusion.
          By juxtaposing the concept of a
          zombie with the duality inherent in
          the Black body's experience, the film
          serves as a mirror reflecting the
          contradictions that shape and define
          identity.

          is deconstructed
          book that offers readers the
          opportunity to forge their own
          narrative paths, paralleling the
          dismantled society depicted in
          Octavia Butler's science fiction
          masterpiece of the same name.
          Rooted in the foundational text of
          Octavia Butler's <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Speech
            Sounds</span>,
          this project emerges as an intricate
          amalgamation of narratives,
          converging three pivotal texts -
          Speech Sounds itself, <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">After Words</span>
          by Nikita Gale, and a thought-provoking
          interview with Octavia
          Butler and Samuel Delany.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text is accompanied by the
          inclusion of evocative stills from
          Ousmane Sembène's <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">La
            Noire De
            (Black Girl)</span> and Dawoud Bey's
          poignant photo series <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Night Coming
            Tenderly, Black</span>. These carefully
          chosen images serve as a visual
          chorus, further enriching the
          conversation woven throughout the
          deconstructed book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collage of text, image, and filmic
          references operates as a symphony
          of perspectives, all converging to
          explore themes deeply rooted in
          race, language, and the
          decolonization of identity. Octavia
          Butler's exploration of language's
          transformation and deterioration
          underlines this narrative journey,
          mirroring the destruction and erosion
          of language through colonization
          and slavery. Yet, from the ruins of
          linguistic upheaval emerges the
          possibility of something anew.

          pays homage to
          histories lost, cultures eroded, and
          identities reshaped, all while
          illuminating the potential for
          resilience and the birth of novel
          relationships. In a masterful interplay
          of words, images, and philosophies,
          <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">speech
            sounds</span>
          is an invitation to
          ponder the profound ways in which
          society survives and regenerates.

          As a celebration of the Center’s rich history in the Yale and New Haven community, the Yale School of Art
          presents <span style="font-style: italic;font-weight: bold;">Brought it Home: A Continuum.</span> This Black
          History Month art show, presented by Yale School of Art MFA Students, was installed throughout the
          Afro-American Cultural Center during Black History Month. This multidisciplinary programming is a nod to the
          Center’s role as a nexus of vibrant collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through cross-disciplinary collaboration and experimentation, MFA students will work to create a multimedia
          art experience open to the School of Art and wider Yale community. By documenting this exhibition through a
          website, this show will serve as a guide to future students interested in collaborating, not only with other
          School of Art students, but with other centers and departments around the school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alvin Ashiatey and I designed and built the website for the show. Kathryn-Kay Johnson and Kyle Richardson
          designed the identity. Ashley Teamer and Chinaedu Nwadibia organized and curated the show. Sarah Elawad and
          David Jon Walker designed the merch.

The bucket hat was popularized by Black Hip-Hop bigwigs, no surprises there. If we think of Hip-Hop as a major movement of creative Black labor in the United States, then we can think of the bucket hat as part of the uniform of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">“black collar” labor</span>. The human as Black, the subject as Hip-Hop, the object, as hat, references a form of primarily Black labor.
         </p>
        <p>
While "blue collar" and "white collar" are more common terms referring to manual and professional work, respectively, the idea of <span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">"black collar" labor</span> could suggest a creative and culturally rooted form of work and expression, which hip-hop indeed embodies, "built" on the experiences, struggles, and creativity of Black individuals and communities.
