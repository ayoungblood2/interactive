                is migrant.</h2><br>
            <p class="ex1">Words move from language to language, from culture to culture, from mouth to mouth. Our
                bodies are
                migrants;
                cells and bacteria are migrants too. Even galaxies migrate.</h2>
                <p class="ex1">What is then this talk against migrants? It can only be talk against ourselves, against
                    life itself.
                </p>
                <p class="ex1">Twenty years ago, I opened up the word <i>“migrant,”</i> seeing in it a dangerous mix of
                    Latin and
                    Germanic roots. I imagined <i>“migrant”</i> was probably composed of mei, Latin for <i>“to change or
                        move,”</i> and gra, <i>“heart”</i> from the Germanic kerd. Thus, <i>“migrant”</i> became
                    <i>“changed
                        heart,”</i>
                    a heart in pain, changing the heart of the earth. The word <i>“immigrant”</i> says, <i>“grant me
                        life.”</i> </p>
                <p class="ex1"><i>“Grant”</i> means <i>“to allow, to have,”</i> and is related to an ancient
                    Proto-Indo-European
                    root:
                    dhe, the mother of <i>“deed”</i> and <i>“law.”</i> So too, sacerdos, performer of sacred rites.</p>
                <p class="ex1"> What is the rite performed by millions of people displaced and seeking safe haven
                    around the world? Letting us see our own indifference, our complicity in the ongoing wars?</p>
                <p class="ex1">Is their pain powerful enough to allow us to change our hearts? To see our part in it?
                </p>
                <p class="ex1">I <i>“wounder,”</i> said Margarita, my immigrant friend, mixing up wondering and
                    wounding, a perfect
                    embodiment of our true condition!</p>
                <p class="ex1">Vicente Huidobro said,<br><i>“Open your mouth to receive the host of the wounded
                        word.”</i></p>
                <p class="ex1">
                    <i>The wound is an eye. Can we look into its eyes?</i><br><i>my specialty is not feeling,
                        just</i><br><i>looking, so I say:</i><br><i>(the word is a hard look.)</i><br><b>—Rosario
                        Castellanos</b>
                </p>

                <br><br><br><br>
                <p class="ex2">In l980, I was in exile in Bogotá, where I was working on my <b>“Palabrarmas”</b>
                    project, a way of
                    opening words to see what they have to say. My early life as a poet was guided by a line from
                    <b>Novalis</b>: <i>“Poetry is the original religion of mankind.”</i> Living in the violent city of
                    Bogotá, I wanted to see if anybody shared this view, so I set out with a camera and a team of
                    volunteers
                    to interview people in the street. I asked everybody I met, <i>“What is Poetry to you?”</i> and I
                    got
                    great answers from beggars, prostitutes, and policemen alike. But the best was, <i>“Que prosiga,”
                        “That
                        it may go on”</i>—how can I translate the subjunctive, the most beautiful tiempo verbal (time
                    inside
                    the verb) of the Spanish language? <b>“Subjunctive”</b> means <b>“next to”</b> but under the power
                    of
                    the unknown. It is a future potential subjected to unforeseen conditions, and that matches exactly
                    the
                    quantum definition of emergent properties.</p>
                <p class="ex2">If you google the subjunctive you will find it described as a <i>“mood,”</i> as if a
                    verbal tense
                    could
                    feel:<br><i>“The subjunctive mood is the verb form used to express a wish, a suggestion, a command,
                        or a
                        condition that is contrary to fact.”</i><br>Or<br><i>“the ‘present’ subjunctive is the bare form
                        of
                        a verb (that is, a verb with no ending).”</i> </p>
                <p class="ex2">I loved that! A never-ending image of a naked verb! The man who passed by as a shadow in
                    my film
                    saying
                    <i>“Que prosiga”</i> was on camera only for a second, yet he expressed in two words the utter
                    precision
                    of Indigenous oral culture.</p>
                <p class="ex2">People watching the film today can’t believe it was not scripted, because in thirty-six
                    years we seem
                    to
                    have forgotten the art of complex conversation. In the film people in the street improvise responses
                    on
                    the spot, displaying an awareness of language that seems to be missing today. I wounder, how did it
                    change? And my heart says it must be fear, the ocean of lies we live in, under a continuous stream
                    of
                    doublespeak by the violent powers that rule us. Living under dictatorship, the first thing that
                    disappears is playful speech, the fun and freedom of saying what you really think. Complex public
                    conversation goes extinct, and along with it, the many species we are causing to disappear as we
                    speak.
                </p>
                <p class="ex1">The word <i>“species”</i> comes from the Latin speciēs, <i>“a seeing.”</i> Maybe we are
                    losing
                    species
                    and languages, our joy, because we don’t wish to see what we are doing. </p>
                <p class="ex1">Not seeing the seeing in words, we numb our senses. </p>
                <p class="ex1">I hear a <i>“low continuous humming sound”</i> of <i>“unmanned aerial vehicles,”</i> the
                    drones we
                    send
                    out into the world carrying our killing thoughts.</p>
                <p class="ex1">Drones are the ultimate expression of our disconnect with words, our ability to speak
                    without feeling
                    the
                    effect or consequences of our words. </p>

                    Our words are becoming drones, flying robots. Are we becoming desensitized
                    by not feeling them as acts? I
                    am thinking not just of the victims but also of the perpetrators, the drone operators. Tonje Hessen
                    Schei, director of the film Drone, speaks of how children are being trained to kill by video
                    games:<p class="ex2"><b>“War is made to look fun, killing is made to look cool. ... I think this
                            ‘militainment’

                    a
                    whole.

                        Language is the translator. Could it translate us to a place within where we cease to
                        tolerate injustice and the destruction of life?
                        Life is language. <b>“When we speak, life speaks,”</b> says the Kaushitaki Upanishad.
                        Awareness creates itself looking at itself.
                        It is transient and eternal at the same time.
